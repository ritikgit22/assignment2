        "Ans - Here's a comprehensive explanation of string slicing in Python, incorporating examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "**String Slicing:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Extracting Substrings:** String slicing is a powerful technique that allows you to extract specific portions (substrings) from a string.\n",
        "- **Syntax:** `string[start:stop:step]`\n",
        "    - `start` (optional): The index of the first character to include in the substring. If omitted, it defaults to 0 (the beginning of the string).\n",
        "    - `stop` (optional): The index of the first character *not* to include in the substring. If omitted, it defaults to the length of the string (including the character at that index).\n",
        "    - `step` (optional): The number of characters to skip between each character in the substring. If omitted, it defaults to 1 (every character is included).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Examples:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Basic Slicing:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   string = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Extract the first 5 characters\n",
        "   substring1 = string[0:5]  # Output: \"Hello\"\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Extract characters from index 7 to the end\n",
        "   substring2 = string[7:]    # Output: \"World!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Extract every other character\n",
        "   substring3 = string[::2]    # Output: \"Hlo ol!\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Negative Indices:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Negative indices count from the end of the string.\n",
        "   - `string[-1]` refers to the last character, `string[-2]` refers to the second-to-last character, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Extract the last 3 characters\n",
        "   substring4 = string[-3:]   # Output: \"ld!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "   # Extract characters from the beginning to the second-to-last character\n",
        "   substring5 = string[:-1]   # Output: \"Hello, World\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Reversing Strings:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   - A `step` value of `-1` reverses the substring.\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Reverse the entire string\n",
        "   reversed_string = string[::-1]  # Output: \"!dlroW ,olleH\"\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Points:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Slicing always creates a new string, leaving the original string unchanged.\n",
        "- If `start` is greater than or equal to `stop`, an empty string is returned.\n",
        "- Out-of-range indices are handled gracefully. If `start` is too large or `stop` is too small, the slice is adjusted to the nearest valid index.\n",
        "- Slicing can be combined with other string operations for more complex manipulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Additional Notes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- You can use string slicing to efficiently perform various string-related tasks, such as:\n",
        "    - Checking if a substring exists within a string\n",
        "    - Extracting specific parts of formatted data\n",
        "    - Modifying strings by replacing or inserting substrings\n",
        "- Practice using string slicing to become proficient in this essential technique.\n"

        "   - **`remove()`:** Remove the first occurrence of a specific value.\n",
        "   - **`pop()`:** Remove an element at a specific index (or the last element if no index is provided).\n",
        "   - **`index()`:** Find the index of the first occurrence of a value.\n",
        "   - **`count()`:** Count the number of occurrences of a value.\n",
        "   - **`sort()`:** Sort the elements in ascending order.\n",

        "Ans - Why Dictionary Keys Must Be Immutable\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable objects. This means they cannot be changed after they are created. This requirement is fundamental to the efficient implementation of dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reasons for Immutability:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hashing:** Dictionaries use hashing to store and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently. The hash value of a key is used to determine its location within the dictionary. If keys could be changed, their hash values would also change, making it impossible to find them.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Consistency:** Immutability ensures that the hash value of a key remains constant throughout its lifetime. This allows the dictionary to maintain consistent lookup behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Efficiency:** Immutable objects can be shared between multiple data structures without causing conflicts. This can improve performance and memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Examples of Immutable Objects:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Numbers:** Integers, floats, and complex numbers are immutable.\n",
        "* **Strings:** Strings are also immutable.\n",
        "* **Tuples:** Tuples are immutable collections of elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Examples of Mutable Objects (Not Suitable as Keys):**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Lists:** Lists can be modified, so they cannot be used as dictionary keys.\n",
        "* **Dictionaries:** Dictionaries themselves are mutable and cannot be used as keys.\n",
        "* **Sets:** Sets are mutable and cannot be used as keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Consequences of Using Mutable Objects as Keys:**\n",
        "\n",
        "If you try to use a mutable object as a dictionary key, you might encounter unexpected behavior. The dictionary may not be able to find the key correctly, leading to incorrect results or errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "my_dict = {[\"a\", \"b\"]: \"value\"}  # Using a list as a key\n",
        "\n",
        "# Trying to modify the key will cause problems\n",
        "my_dict[[\"a\", \"b\"]][0] = \"c\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# The dictionary may not be able to find the key anymore\n",
        "print(my_dict)  # Output: {}\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the immutability of dictionary keys is essential for the efficient and reliable operation of dictionaries in Python. By understanding this requirement and using immutable objects as keys, you can avoid potential issues and write more robust code."
